RFC 7000		    R-Type Protocol      	       July 2011

3.2.3 Object

   All the following things described below are all considered as
   object.

3.2.3.1 Players

  A player is a object which is controle by one of the player. It will
  change of behavior by the several events emits by the different player.

3.2.3.2 Ennemies

   R-Type is not a pushover. Indeed, you will find in your way a horde
   of ennemies who only want one thing: kill you and your friends.
   You have two options to survive. Kill all the monsters you will
   cross in your way or avoid their attacks by passing through the crowd.

   Be carefull, a simple contact with an ennemy's bullet or this one
   will kill you directly (see the part below this one on collison).

3.2.3.3 Bullets

   They should use their weapon to shoot their ennemies. A player may
   enhance the power of the bullets by keeping the shoot's key pushed.
   The more you do, the more the players weapon's power will increase.
   Each bullet is unique and linked to a particular player.
   The ennemy can shoot the player too with their own bullets.

3.2.3.4 Bonus

   A player can get bonuses. They can appear by killing ennemies or just
   randomly in the middle of the game.

3.2.4 Collision

   A player is very vulnerable. A contact with an ennemy or with some
   elements of the level (for example a space rock...) will kill him. A
   client will be notified by the server when he will be touched by one
   of those elements. You MUST be carefull!

3.2.5 Scoring

   R-Type is a shoot them up, a system of scoring is of course necessary
   to add more competitivity between players and much more fun.

   To get your score increased, you have to kill monsters or get the
   bonuses on the map.

3.2.6 Game Over

   Like it has been explain previously, a simple contact with the map, an
   ennemy or his bullets consume one life. When all the players have no
   life left, the game is over.
