RFC 7000		    R-Type Protocol      	       July 2011

1.  INTRODUCTION

   The RTP (R-Type Protocol) has been designed over a number of years
   to add an online multiplayer dimension to the game based on a
   client-server architecture. This document describes the current RTP.

   The RTP has been developed on systems using the TCP/IP and UDP
   network protocol. In which TCP/IP will be used for all the settings
   of the game and important packets, as for the UDP to exchange
   informations in-game.

   R-Type itself is a side scrolling shoot them up arcade game produced
   1987. The player controls a space fighter to defend humanity against
   a mysterious but powerful alien life-form known as "Bydo".
