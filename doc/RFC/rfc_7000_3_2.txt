               Figure 1: Initialization of the connection and
			 prelude of a game.

3.2 In-game

   This section is devoted to describ the actual organization made
   between the client and the server during the game.

3.2.1 Prelude

   It's in this phase that the clients will receive the informations
   about the ships they will play with.

3.2.2 Event

   When the clients have received all the informations, they will be
   able to act in the level in which they are. Let us see what they are
   allowed to do.

3.2.2.1 Movement

   A player MAY move in the level. He MUST send to the server the
   direction he took. There is two messages to send. One when he begin
   to push the button and one when he released this one. He MAY go up,
   down, left or right. That move is calculated by the server and sent
   back to all the players in the game.

3.2.2.2 Leave

   A player MAY leave a game when he wants to. He would be a coward in
   the eyes of his/her friend who played with him of course. He will be
   redirected out of the room he is in and invited to chose another one
   room.
